# Communication protocol

This document describes the protocol used for communication between the different nodes of the
distributed application.

## Terminology

* Sensor - a device which senses the environment and describes it with a value (an integer value in
  the context of this project). Examples: temperature sensor, humidity sensor.
* Actuator - a device which can influence the environment. Examples: a fan, a window opener/closer,
  door opener/closer, heater.
* Sensor and actuator node - a computer which has direct access to a set of sensors, a set of
  actuators and is connected to the Internet.
* Control-panel node - a device connected to the Internet which visualizes status of sensor and
  actuator nodes and sends control commands to them.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) - A graphical interface where users of the system can interact with
  it.

## The underlying transport protocol

The group choose to use TCP instead of UDP. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol which means that
a connection is established before any useful data is transferred.
TCP provides features such as error-checking, acknowledgment of received data and retransmission of lost packets.
This ensures that each packet is delivered in the correct order and none is lost or duplicated.
In our greenhouse we need to be sure that each packet is delivered. For instance if one node turns on or off
an actuator, we need to be sure that the other nodes receive this information. TCP also has flow control 
which ensures that the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver with data.

## Choosing of port number

When deciding which port number to use, the group wanted to have an unassigned port number. Ports above 1024
are usually available and not reserved for specific services. This also ensures that well-known ports like 80 (HTTP)
443 (HTTPS) or 22 (SSH) are not used. The group decided to use port 1234.


## The architecture

TODO - show the general architecture of your network. Which part is a server? Who are clients? 
Do you have one or several servers? Perhaps include a picture here. 


## The flow of information and events

TODO - describe what each network node does and when. Some periodic events? Some reaction on 
incoming packets? Perhaps split into several subsections, where each subsection describes one 
node type (For example: one subsection for sensor/actuator nodes, one for control panel nodes).

## Connection and state

TODO - is your communication protocol connection-oriented or connection-less? Is it stateful or 
stateless? 

## Types, constants

TODO - Do you have some specific value types you use in several messages? They you can describe 
them here.

## Message format

TODO - describe the general format of all messages. Then describe specific format for each 
message type in your protocol.

### Error messages

TODO - describe the possible error messages that nodes can send in your system.

## An example scenario

TODO - describe a typical scenario. How would it look like from communication perspective? When 
are connections established? Which packets are sent? How do nodes react on the packets? An 
example scenario could be as follows:
1. A sensor node with ID=1 is started. It has a temperature sensor, two humidity sensors. It can
   also open a window.
2. A sensor node with ID=2 is started. It has a single temperature sensor and can control two fans
   and a heater.
3. A control panel node is started.
4. Another control panel node is started.
5. A sensor node with ID=3 is started. It has a two temperature sensors and no actuators.
6. After 5 seconds all three sensor/actuator nodes broadcast their sensor data.
7. The user of the first-control panel presses on the button "ON" for the first fan of
   sensor/actuator node with ID=2.
8. The user of the second control-panel node presses on the button "turn off all actuators".

## Reliability and security

TODO - describe the reliability and security mechanisms your solution supports.
